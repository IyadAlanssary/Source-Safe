# Source Safe
This project, developed as a 5th-year university project for the Network Applications course, is a simplified implementation of the principles found in [Microsoft's Visual SourceSafe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_SourceSafe)

## Introduction

The application is divided into two parts: the front-end and the back-end. The front-end, which is what you're currently viewing, is written in Dart using the Flutter framework. The back-end can be found at (link to repo).

## Key Features

-   Ability to upload and download files from the projects you're participating in.
-   File check-in system that allows only the user who checked it in to edit or delete the file.
-   File check-out system for when you've finished editing a file.
-   Project (group) creation and user assignment functionality (admin-only feature).
-   Capability to create and delete folders within projects.
